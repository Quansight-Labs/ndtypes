Overview
########

ndtypes implements a low-level version of
`Datashape <http://datashape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Datashape is a data description language for modern array computing capable
of handling complex memory layouts, tagged union data types, pattern matching,
polymorphism and much more.

The goal of ndtypes is to provide a common foundation for data interchange
as well as computation on data by defining typed memory in a concise,
human-readable way.
